This package contains LaTeX and MS-Word files to help in the
preparation of a publication for AMCA publications and conferences.

The examples (`amcapaper.pdf') are self-explanatory. The author can
copy the source files (`amcapaper.tex' for LaTeX and `amcapaper.dot'
for MS-Word) and start replacing the appropriated text.

Additional help for LaTeX and MS-Word is given in `README.latex' and
`README.msword', respectively.
